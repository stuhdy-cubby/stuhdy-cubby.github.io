## Overview
### The Problem
ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and donâ€™t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.

### The Solution
stuhdy cubby is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.
