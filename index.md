## Overview
### The Problem
ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and donâ€™t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.

### The Solution
stuhdy cubby is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.

# User Guide
### Landing page
### User home page
### Admin home page
### User profile page
### Calendar page
### Create Study Sesh page
### Study session page
### Game mechanic page(s) (for example, a leaderboard?)

* Slack integration to facilitate notification and organization of meetings.
* A Slack Bot to suggest and help implement Study Buddy meetings.
* A rating system for meetings and sensei participation.
