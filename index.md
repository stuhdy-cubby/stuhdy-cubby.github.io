## Overview
### The Problem
ICS students often spend more time than they need on their homework and don’t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.

### The Solution
stuhdy cubby is an application for UHM ICS students to self-organize face-to-face study groups around a course and/or specific homework or project topic.

## Development History
The development process for stUHdy cubby conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s21/morea/project-management/reading-guidelines-idpm.html) practices. In a nutshell:

* Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
* Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
* Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
* Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
* The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named “issue-XX”, where XX is replaced by the issue number.
* When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
* The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.

## Testcafe
